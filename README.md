## Project Title
**Privacy-Focused Social Network**

## Project Description
This project is designed to create a social platform that emphasizes user privacy and data security by leveraging blockchain technology. The smart contract forms the core of the platform, enabling users to post, retrieve, and update content in a secure and decentralized manner. Content can be encrypted off-chain before being stored, ensuring that sensitive data remains private.



## Project Vision
Our vision is to build a decentralized social network where users regain control over their data. By combining blockchain technology with advanced encryption techniques, the platform aims to provide a secure space for sharing ideas and content without the risks associated with centralized data storage. We envision a community where transparency and privacy coexist, empowering users to manage their digital identities securely.

## Future Scope
- **Enhanced Privacy Mechanisms:** Integrate advanced cryptographic methods to further secure user data and control access.
- **Decentralized Identity Verification:** Develop mechanisms for user verification that do not compromise privacy.
- **Interoperability:** Allow integration with other decentralized applications and platforms, expanding the networkâ€™s functionality.
- **Scalability Improvements:** Optimize the smart contract and network infrastructure to handle a growing number of users and interactions.
- **User Incentivization:** Implement token-based rewards for active participation and quality content contributions.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Data Storage:** Leverages blockchain to ensure that data remains secure and tamper-proof.
- **User-Controlled Privacy:** Enables users to encrypt their content before posting, ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt and view sensitive information.
- **Immutable Audit Trail:** Every post and update is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and verifiable history of user actions.
- **Permissioned Updates:** Only the original content creator is allowed to update their posts, maintaining content integrity.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Uses events for monitoring and off-chain interactions, making integration with other systems seamless.
